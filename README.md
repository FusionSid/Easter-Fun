# Easter-Fun

A website I made in about 20min as a april fools prank. 

The Plan: Print 50 qr codes and put them around the school. Some people will believe that there is a easter party and will click the link - AND GET RICKROLLED

What happened: I printed 50qr codes only to realise once i reached school that the link on the qr code had an extra letter at the end which made it not work. :(

mission failed - we'll get em next time
